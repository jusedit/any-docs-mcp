## Concepts

**Source:** http://127.0.0.1:4032/docs/concepts

The Concepts section helps you learn about the parts of the Kubernetes system and the abstractions Kubernetes uses to represent your [cluster](/docs/reference/glossary/?all=true#term-cluster "A set of worker machines, called nodes, that run containerized applications. Every cluster has at least one worker node."), and helps you obtain a deeper understanding of how Kubernetes works.

## [Overview](/docs/concepts/overview/)
Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open source platform for managing containerized workloads and services that facilitate both declarative configuration and automation. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely available.

##### [Services, Load Balancing, and Networking](/docs/concepts/services-networking/)
Concepts and resources behind networking in Kubernetes.
##### [Storage](/docs/concepts/storage/)
Ways to provide both long-term and temporary storage to Pods in your cluster.
